HOLES(1)                    General Commands Manual                   HOLES(1)

NAME
     holes – find runs of zero bytes

SYNOPSIS
     holes [-b byte] [-n minlen] [-sx] [files ...]

DESCRIPTION
     holes looks for runs of zero bytes (a.k.a. holes) in the specified input
     files (or the standard input), and prints the start addresses as well as
     the lengths (in decimal).  When multiple input files are specified, holes
     prefixes each line with the file name.

     The options are as follows:

     -b byte
             Count runs of byte, a number between 0 and 255, instead of zero
             bytes.

     -n minlen
             Change minimum size of holes reported.  By default, only holes of
             at least 64 bytes are reported.

     -s      Print a summary at the end how many percent of the file are runs
             of zeroes.

     -x      Print the start addresses as hexadecimal numbers.

EXIT STATUS
     The holes utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
