.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
looks for runs of zero bytes (a.k.a. holes) in the specified input files
(or the standard input),
and prints the start addresses as well as the lengths (in decimal).
When multiple input files are specified,
.Nm
prefixes each line with the file name.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b Ar byte
Count runs of
.Ar byte ,
a number between 0 and 255,
instead of zero bytes.
.It Fl n Ar minlen
Change minimum size of holes reported.
By default,
only holes of at least 64 bytes are reported.
.It Fl S
Don't search for zeroes but use
.Dv SEEK_HOLE
to find the sparse areas of the file, according to the filesystem.
.It Fl s
Print a summary at the end how many percent of the file are runs of zeroes.
.It Fl x
Print the start addresses as hexadecimal numbers.
